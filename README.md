# WizMote custom firmware (WLED compatible)
This firmware restores default behaviour of the most common WizMote firmware.

I observed that there are diffrent versions of the so calles WizMote remote, the most common one is supported by WLED via ESP-NOW.
Via Amazon germany I also got hold of a version of the remote (imported by "REV Ritter GmbH") which runs a different firmware that is not compatible with the current WLED (Verison 0.14.0) implementation.

The Hardware of said version seems to also be a bit different.

After flashing this firmware to the remote via the programming header it works with WLED as expected.
